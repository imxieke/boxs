## Branch Pacman should use (stable, testing, unstable)
Branch = stable

## Generation method
## 1) rank   - rank mirrors depending on their access time
## 2) random - randomly generate the output mirrorlist
Method = rank

## Filename to use when ranking mirrors
## The file must be present in core repo
# TestFile = core.db.tar.gz

## Specify to use only mirrors from specific a country.
## Can add multiple countries separated by a comma (ex: Germany,France)
## Empty means all
OnlyCountry = China

## Define protocols and priority
##   separated by comma 'https,http' or 'http,https'
## ATM available protocols are: http, https, ftp
## Not specifying a protocol will ban the protocol from being used
## If a mirror has more than one protocol defined only the first is written to the mirrorlist
## Empty means all in reversed alphabetic order
Protocols = https

## Mirrors directory
MirrorlistsDir = /etc/pacman.d/mirrors

## Output file
OutputMirrorlist = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

## When set to False - all certificates are accepted.
## Use only if you fully trust all ssl-enabled mirrors.
# SSLVerify = True

## When set to True prevents the regeneration of the mirrorlist if
## pacman-mirrors is invoked with the --no-update argument.
## Useful if you don't want the mirrorlist regenerated after a
## pacman-mirrors package upgrade.
NoUpdate = True
